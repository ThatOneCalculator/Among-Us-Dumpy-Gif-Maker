# EULA/TOS/Privacy Policy for Among Us Dumpy GIF Maker and Among Us Dumpy Bot

Note: Please be aware that only our Terms of Service in English are legally binding. While translations of these documents may be provided for your convenience, they are translated by the community and are thus not legal documents.

This Terms of Service document applies to the official instance of Among Us Dumpy GIF Maker and Among Us Dumpy Bot. Self-hosted instances may choose to adopt this document if they wish.

I want to keep this short and sweet, because let's be real: nobody likes reading these things. (And I don't like writing them, either.)

## Terms of Service:

1. You must follow [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) when using Among Us Dumpy Bot.
2. Material illegal in the United States of America cannot be uploaded to the bot for processing.
3. You must abide by the [A-GPLv3 License](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/Among-Us-Dumpy-Gif-Maker/blob/main/LICENSE) for forking/modifying/redistributing code (TL;DR: keep it Free and Open Source).
4. I am not responsible for any damage caused by installing the AUR package for Among Us Dumpy GIF Maker, even though it *should* be harmless. Always use caution and audit any PKGBUILDs when installing packages from the AUR, it's good practice.
5. Do not harrass the owners, contributors, artists, or anyone else involved in this project.
6. Do not claim you made Among Us Dumpy GIF Maker or Among Us Dumpy Bot. This has happened in the past, and kinda sucks :/

## Privacy Policy:

I like privacy, you like privacy. No user  profiling is done through Among Us Dumpy GIF Maker nor Among Us Dumpy Bot.
However, some (very minimal) data is collected:
- Saved user backgrounds (stored as png files)
- Guild preferences (stored in a local MongoDB database)
- Blacklisted guild members (stored in a local MongoDB database)
- Disabled guild channels (stored in a local MongoDB database)

We will never, ***ever*** sell your data to anyone or use your data. The bot is hosted on a private VPS controlled by ThatOneCalculator alone.

### That's it. Have a good day!
